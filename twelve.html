    <span style="font-size: 5px;">What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader?</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 10px;">The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea.</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 15px;">In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph.</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 20px;">A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow.</span><br>
    <span style="font-size: 25px;">The whole process is an organic oneâ€”a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.</span>
